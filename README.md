# Garbage control 

Garbage control is a lightweight C library to easily manage allocated memory, it is made to be compliant with the [42 Norme](https://github.com/42school/norminette/tree/master "Norminette github repo") with the intention to be used in my [Minishell Project](https://github.com/luna7111/shrapnel "My minishell github repo").

While this code is published under a MIT license, i do not recomend it's use, if you are a 42 student, writing your own code is the only way to learn how to be a good coder. If you are not, this project isn't exactly optimal due to limitations like the forenamed 42 Norme and forbidden functions.

## Documentation

You can see the full docs [here (this link is currently dead)]().  

Garbage control offers a set of functions to allocate, free and otherwise manage memory in a C program while keeping track of every allocated pointer so memory leaks can be easily prevented.

The library uses a linked list to track every pointer, each node of the list contains the pointer and it's state (whether it is a single pointer, an array, is it protected...).
